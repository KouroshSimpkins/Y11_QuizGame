# Database Information ðŸ’¾

The database storing the information in this system is designed as to be as flexible as possible. For any users, as such setup for the quiz database should be done via the config.py file.

I know that the current database design doesn't take answers into account. I'll move onto that once I have an effective method for ensuring that data can be read from the database effectively, without messing any of the data up. I'm hoping to have that done by the end of next week. Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ We shall see, as I have more pressing problems to deal with. *([like this](https://github.com/KouroshSimpkins/CompSci-NEA))*

I have written the questions that are currently loaded into the database, it shouldn't be too difficult to modify them though.
