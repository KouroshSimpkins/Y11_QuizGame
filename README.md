 A computer science quiz game for year 11 students

This game is designed for year 11 students at my school to test their computer science skills. As such the questions will all be of a level that can be easily understood by a GCSE student.

Even though it is designed for GCSE students, it will be relatively easy to modify to be a quiz game for any level of expertise and any subject. I'll probably add a config file to make it easier for an end user to modify questions, answers and the instructions for the game, among other things.
